abstract = {This demonstration paper presents an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered interactive interface designed to enhance interview training for military veterans transitioning to civilian jobs. The interface uses large language models (LLMs) to provide real-time feedback on veterans’ responses to common interview questions, classifying answers as under-explained, succinct, comprehensive, or over-explained. The system further offers a justification of its decision, potentially enhancing the user’s understanding of their responses and identifying areas for improvement. This tool aims to bridge the gap between military and civilian employment, addressing unique challenges faced by veterans and potentially extending to other sensitive groups in future applications.},
