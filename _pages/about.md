Hi, I’m Ghritachi — a software engineer with 4+ years of experience in building web and mobile applications, now specializing in **machine learning** and generative AI.

After several years developing high-impact apps at scale, I became fascinated by the potential of LLMs and AI systems. I recently graduated with a Master’s in Computer Science from CU Boulder (May, 2025, GPA 4.0), where I’ve worked on AI-powered distributed applications, LLM explainability research, and scalable ML pipelines.

My focus now is **building production-ready ML systems** — combining real-world data, models and frameworks such as LangChain, and DevOps tools like MLlfow, Docker and more. Explore my [projects](https://gritsiem.github.io/projects/) or check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/gritsiem).

Feel free to connect — I love talking about AI systems, UI design, or the occasional anime reference.

Nice to meet you!

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
