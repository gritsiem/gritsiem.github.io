Hi! I am a Computer Science Master's student from the University of Colorado, Boulder. I have 4 years of work experience as a Frontend Software Developer and my interests lie in Machine Learning. I am currently doing research in explainability when it comes to decision-making of Large Language Models. 

My skills include full-stack (HTML and template engines, CSS and SASS preprocessors , React, JS and associated libraries, Node.js, Flask, PostgreSQL, GCP). I enjoy coding in Python and have worked with most machine learning libraries. I am experienced in client-facing roles as well as working within cross-functional teams. 

My hobbies are music (I am learning the guitar), watching anime and trying new things! Welcome to my website!


<!-- Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
