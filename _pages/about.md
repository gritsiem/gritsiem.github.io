Hi! I am a Computer Science Master's student (graduating May, 2025) from the University of Colorado, Boulder. I have 4 years of work experience as a Software Engineer working in client-facing roles with cross-functional teams. Currently I am doing research on free-text rationales when it comes to decision-making of Large Language Models. 

I enjoy working on Machine Learning problems - whether it is cleaning and analysing data to find interesting insights, creating statistical deep learning model to achieve learning goals, or building scalable systems for them. I have hands on experience with various Python tools and frameworks (Numpy, Pandas, PyTorch, Scikit-learn) as well as scalable cloud technologies (GCP, Docker, Kubernetes). I also know full-stack ( Web development, React, Flask, SQL). 

Nice to meet you!

<!-- Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
